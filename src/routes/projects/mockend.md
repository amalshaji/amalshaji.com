## Features

- Create apps to manage endpoints
- Create multiple endpoints per app
- Create endpoints that resemble your original API. Thus, switching between `dev` and `prod` will be as easy as changing the `BASE_URL`
- api-key authorisation via `X-API-KEY` header. It is disabled by default.
- [Custom response model](https://docs.mockend.in/#/payload). Choose from `97` supported [data types](https://docs.mockend.in/#/datatypes), and some of them offer customisation.
- Support for dynamic endpoints(`/api/{id}`)
- JSON editor available to create schema
- Swagger UI for each application to test out your endpoints right from the browser
- Create bulk endpoints using app schema(a file that describes all the endpoints of an app).
